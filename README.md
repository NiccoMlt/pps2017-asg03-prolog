## Assignment instructions (from University e-learning website) ##

> In this assignment, you are asked to put into practice what you have learnt about Prolog, LP, and multi-paradigms integration. 
> You will freely decide what to implement. 
> It can be based on some lab or something entirely different. 
> Just try to be excellent, LP/multiparadigm, and exercise non-trivial things. 
> Detailed instructions are provided in the assignment template, plus the following:
> 1. the latex template of the Report you have to produce is attached, with detailed instructions on what to do and how to document it;
> 2. the Downloads section of your repository will need to include your PDF version of the Report
>    (we strongly encourage you to write in English and use the provided Latex template, but will tolerate if you write in Italian and use a different word processor);
> 3. you should properly use git to track your changes: recall to commit small and meaningful changes
>    (we may use commits also to check if you actually worked more or less for the right amount of time) -- recall not to track binaries;
> 4. deliver your assignment using this e-learning tool, by just providing the PDF report;
> 5. it is understood that you should not, for obvious reasons, modify the repo after you submitted;
> 6. if produced before the exam, this assignment will be used at the exam to check your knowledge on Scala: 
>    doing it properly will make the exam easier, doing it not so properly does not change things: you will be able to remedy at the exam so do not worry! 
> Suggestion: exercise your skills now!
